## Support Wildfire Relief

A monetary donation allows staff working directly with impacted Slugs to address the ever-changing needs of those affected and gives UCSC the resources to assist students and employees in the long term.

## Guidance to UC Santa Cruz departments and campus-sponsored organizations wanting to start localized efforts to support Slugs in need

The _How to Give Help_ webpage has been established to assist those who wish to provide support to students and employees who have been impacted by the August 2020 wildfires. Campus departments and organizations are encouraged to direct individuals to this page if they are looking for ways to help. If a campus department or organization chooses to launch a localized effort, they should follow [the important guidance outlined in this document](/fire/files/guidance-for-providing-wildfire-relief.pdf).

## Individual offers of housing for those in need

For those who are unable to or choose not to utilize the UC Santa Cruz operated emergency housing locations, Andrea Michels, a retired UC Santa Cruz staff member, is facilitating a list to provide private offers of housing for those in need. This is not part of the official campus emergency housing program, and the campus does not inspect the homes nor does the campus review or vet those indicating they are in need.  This is a volunteer operation run outside the campus emergency housing structure. [The form for those either offering space or in need of space can be accessed  here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtIkjCgrCqxSlLJIUK4RvLSSW5HSYi6sDRvtKkYr_YT20OmQ/viewform).
