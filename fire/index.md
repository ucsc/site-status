### Latest information

<b>{{ site.time | date: "%l:%M %P, %A, %b %d, %Y" }}</b>

As of Friday morning, the fire is about a mile north of upper campus. There is no fire activity on campus or in the City of Santa Cruz, and campus leaders hope that all our activities have been taken in an abundance of caution. 

The residential campus has been completely evacuated and remains closed. 

This morningâ€™s news reports indicate that approximately 50,000 acres have burned so far and the fire is 0% contained. The fire continues to advance, and much of what will happen next depends on weather conditions such as wind direction and speed. UC Santa Cruz will continue to provide updates and information about the campus on this page. 

Chancellor Cynthia Larive [thanked everyone involved in the fire response](https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/ucsc-fire-update.html). 

**Based on a [Declaration of Emergency by Chancellor Cynthia Larive](https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/chancellor-declaration.html) and a subsequent [evacuation order](https://news.ucsc.edu/2020/08/images/calfire-order.pdf) from CalFire, ALL employees and students living in campus housing must evacuate.** Everyone must immediately leave the UC Santa Cruz residential campus and be prepared to not return for at least two weeks. UC Santa Cruz Police Officers will be going door to door to evacuate those remaining on campus.

People will also not be allowed to enter UC Santa Cruz residential campus because of the mandatory evacuation. Access to the residential campus will be limited to first responders and those authorized by me or my designee.

Any person who enters the residential campus, a closed off area or remains in the area after being ordered to evacuate may be found guilty of a criminal offense.

**An evacuation center for UC Santa Cruz students and employees living on campus** is in the Cocoanut Grove at the Boardwalk (use entrance B), 400 Beach Street, Santa Cruz. Parking is in the lot adjacent to the Coconut Grove. 

To reach the evacuation center at the Boardwalk, individuals may drive, walk, bicycle, or use a bus, if available. Please exit the main entrance at Bay Street and High Street to leave the campus. 

Campus transit shuttles or Metro route 19 are available for those on campus to get to the Boardwalk.  Please go to the nearest loop transit stop to board a shuttle or bus.

**Evacuation centers for the broader Santa Cruz community are open** at Santa Cruz County Fairground, 2601 E. Lake Avenue in Watsonville, and Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, 307 Church Street, Santa Cruz.  

Because of this evacuation order, traffic may be congested. Campus community members who do not go to the Boardwalk should leave Santa Cruz on Highway 1 south. The best way to leave the Westside is taking Bay Street to Mission Street to Highway 1. 

Only use 911 for true emergencies. 

This continues to be a rapidly changing situation, and we encourage everyone to stay safe and informed. We ask each of you to monitor conditions that impact you locally as each of your situations will differ.
