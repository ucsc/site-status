UC Santa Cruz continues to closely track the fires in Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, and neighboring counties. This event has resulted in multiple evacuations and air quality concerns.

Should a campus evacuation be necessary, a [CruzAlert](https://oes.ucsc.edu/cruzalert/) will be sent. Please heed the CruzAlert. The CruzAlert will outline the actions to take and the evacuation location to report to. As we prepare for a potential evacuation, the following is critical:

- Though most operations are currently remote due to COVID-19, **it is important to minimize the number of people on campus who would have to be evacuated.** We ask that managers and supervisors limit, to the extent possible, the number of people working on-site, unless their role is in direct support of fire response, COVID-19 mitigation, or other essential functions needed to support those living on campus or supporting critical infrastructure.
- **If you live on campus and you have a safe place to relocate to out of the area, we continue to strongly encourage you to proactively relocate.** This reduces the number of people on campus we need to evacuate and also reduces additional strain on traffic and the roadways leading into and out of the Santa Cruz area. Some roadways, including Empire Grade and Highway 1 headed north of Western Drive, are closed to prevent individuals traveling into areas within the evacuation zone.
- Please be prepared for a quick evacuation whether you live on campus or in the region. An emergency can strike quickly. Advance notice may be very brief. Please continue to follow the Red Cross evacuation preparation guidance. More information can be found on the Red Cross Wildfire Safety website.
  - Be ready in a momentâ€™s notice; be sure to pack belongings such as clothing, non-perishable foods for you and your service or support animal if you have one, medications and copies of important documents.
  - If you have not already done so, sign up for or update your UCSC Cruz Alert notifications here -- this is among the most effective means for receiving urgent campus-specific information and updates. Updates may also be found here.
  - Listen to local radio and television stations for updated emergency information.
  - Students living on campus who do not have access to a vehicle will receive directions from the campus in the event evacuation is deemed necessary. Transit support will be provided to move you from campus to a UCSC evacuation site.
  - Please have your University ID or other form of identification with you if you plan to go to the UCSC evacuation site.
  - It may be helpful to bring your own bed linens, pillows, towels, etc.
  - More information can be found on the Red Cross Wildfire Safety website.
- Continue to follow COVID-19 prevention best practices, including wearing a face covering and physical distancing.

This continues to be a rapidly changing situation, and we encourage everyone to stay safe and informed:

The residential campus, Coastal Science Campus, Scotts Valley offices, and Westside Research park do not have an imminent fire threat, though the evacuation area continues to expand and part of our main campus could be in the next evacuation zone. You are advised to be prepared in the event that your area is directed to evacuate.

UC Santa Cruz will send a [CruzAlert](https://oes.ucsc.edu/cruzalert/) if immediate action is required. Please take a moment to ensure your [CruzAlert contact information is updated](https://oes.ucsc.edu/cruzalert/). We ask each of you to monitor conditions that impact you locally as each of your situations will differ.
