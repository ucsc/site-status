### Latest information

<b>{{ site.time | date: "%l:%M %P, %A, %b %d, %Y" }}</b>

Cal Fire lifted its emergency evacuation order for the UC Santa Cruz residential campus at 6 p.m. on Wednesday. 

Chancellor Larive has amended the Aug. 20 emergency declaration so that employees who live at Laureate Court, Hagar Court, Ranch View Terrace, Hagar Meadow, and Cardiff Terrace can return to their homes tonight. The rest of the residential campus remains closed, as do the Coastal Science Campus and Westside Research Park.

**Except for the people living in the employee housing communities outlined above, no one should attempt to access the residential campus, Coastal Science Campus, or Westside Research Park until directed that it is OK to do so.**

As of Wednesday, the fire remains about a mile north of upper campus. Cal Fire crews have established fire lines to try and slow the spread toward the campus and the city of Santa Cruz. Conditions can change quickly, and we continue to monitor the situation closely.

There are approximately 80,100 acres involved, 538 structures have been destroyed, and the fire is now at 19% containment, according to [Cal Fireâ€™s Wednesday morning update](https://files.constantcontact.com/13ae4c7f701/c331c72d-edd3-492f-9648-2be933b8631e.pdf).

There is no fire activity on campus or in the City of Santa Cruz, and we hope that all the campus actions have been taken in an abundance of caution.
